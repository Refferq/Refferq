# Affiliate Referral Code Fix - October 11, 2025

## Issue Fixed

### Problem
Affiliate users were unable to see their referral links in the dashboard. The referral link section showed blank/empty fields.

### Root Causes
1. **API Response Structure**: The affiliate profile API wasn't returning `success: true`, causing the frontend to not process the data correctly
2. **Case Sensitivity**: The affiliate role check was case-sensitive (`data.role === 'affiliate'` vs `data.role === 'AFFILIATE'`)
3. **Missing Referral Codes**: Some existing affiliates might not have had referral codes generated during registration
4. **No Fallback Mechanism**: No way for users to generate a referral code if it was missing

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed API Response Structure
**File**: `src/app/api/affiliate/profile/route.ts`

Added `success: true` to the response:
```typescript
return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,  // ‚Üê Added this
  user: { ... },
  affiliate: user.affiliate,
  stats,
  referrals,
  conversions,
  commissions,
});
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Case Sensitivity in Registration
**File**: `src/lib/auth.ts`

Changed affiliate check to be case-insensitive:
```typescript
// Before
if (data.role === 'affiliate') { ... }

// After
const userRoleLower = data.role.toLowerCase();
if (userRoleLower === 'affiliate') { ... }
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Created Referral Code Generation Endpoint
**File**: `src/app/api/affiliate/generate-code/route.ts` (NEW)

Features:
- Generates referral code if missing
- Creates affiliate profile if doesn't exist
- Returns existing code if already present
- Format: `NAME-XXXX` (e.g., `JOHN-A4B2`)

API Endpoint: `POST /api/affiliate/generate-code`

### 4. ‚úÖ Enhanced Affiliate Dashboard
**File**: `src/app/affiliate/page.tsx`

Added conditional rendering:
- If no referral code: Shows "Generate Referral Code" button
- If referral code exists: Shows referral link and code with copy buttons

---

## How It Works Now

### For New Affiliates
1. User registers with role "AFFILIATE"
2. Status set to "PENDING" (requires admin approval)
3. Affiliate record created automatically with referral code
4. Referral code format: `FIRSTNAME-XXXX` (random 4 chars)

### For Existing Affiliates Without Codes
1. Affiliate logs in to dashboard
2. If no referral code: Sees "Generate Referral Code" button
3. Clicks button ‚Üí API generates code
4. Page reloads ‚Üí Shows referral link and code

### Referral Link Structure
```
https://refferq.vercel.app/r/JOHN-A4B2
```

Where:
- `JOHN` = First 6 letters of affiliate name (uppercase)
- `A4B2` = Random 4-character string
