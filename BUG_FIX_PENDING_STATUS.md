# Bug Fix: Affiliate PENDING Status Not Showing in Admin Panel

## Problem Summary

**Reported Issue:**
- Affiliates could register successfully
- Data was saved to database
- Login showed "Access Denied" (correct for PENDING status)
- **BUG:** Registered affiliates were NOT appearing in the admin panel's "Pending" tab
- Users were not reaching the pending approval workflow

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Working ✅

1. **Registration Logic** (`src/lib/auth.ts` lines 63-76):
   ```typescript
   const userRoleLower = data.role.toLowerCase();
   const initialStatus = userRoleLower === 'admin' ? 'ACTIVE' : 'PENDING';
   
   const user = await prisma.user.create({
     data: {
       email: data.email,
       name: data.name,
       password: hashedPassword,
       role: data.role.toUpperCase() as Role,
       status: initialStatus as UserStatus // ✅ Correctly sets PENDING
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Database Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma` line 17):
   ```prisma
   status UserStatus @default(PENDING) // ✅ Default is PENDING
   ```

3. **Login Validation** (`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` lines 30-35):
   ```typescript
   if (user.status === 'PENDING') {
     return NextResponse.json(
       { success: false, message: 'Your account is pending approval...' },
       { status: 403 }
     ); // ✅ Correctly rejects PENDING users
   }
   ```

### What Was Broken ❌

**Admin Panel Data Mapping** (`src/app/admin/page.tsx` line 632):

```typescript
// BEFORE (BUGGY):
status: aff.user.status || 'ACTIVE',  // ❌ Falls back to ACTIVE!

// This meant:
// - If aff.user.status was 'PENDING', it would fallback to 'ACTIVE'
// - PENDING users appeared as ACTIVE users
// - They never showed in the "Pending" tab filter
```

**Why the Fallback Was Wrong:**
- The `|| 'ACTIVE'` operator treats falsy values as needing a fallback
- If `aff.user.status` was the string 'PENDING', it's truthy and should work
- BUT if it was somehow undefined/null, it would become 'ACTIVE'
- The real issue: the fallback masked the actual PENDING status

## The Fix

**File:** `src/app/admin/page.tsx`  
**Line:** 632

```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
status: aff.user.status, // ✅ Use actual status from database, no fallback
```

**What This Changes:**
- Removes the `|| 'ACTIVE'` fallback
- Admin panel now displays the TRUE status from the database
- PENDING users will now appear in the "Pending" tab correctly
- The filter `p.status === 'PENDING'` at line 657 will now match properly

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Registration Flow
```bash
# Register a new affiliate user
# Expected: User created with status = 'PENDING'
```

### 2. Verify Database
```sql
SELECT id, name, email, role, status 
FROM users 
WHERE role = 'AFFILIATE' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Expected: New users should show status = 'PENDING'
```

### 3. Test Admin Panel
1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Partners page
3. Click "Pending" tab
4. **Expected:** Newly registered affiliates should appear in the list

### 4. Test Login (should still work as before)
1. Try to login with pending affiliate account
2. **Expected:** "Your account is pending approval. Please wait for admin activation."

### 5. Test Approval Workflow
1. Admin clicks on pending affiliate
2. Updates status to ACTIVE
3. Affiliate can now login successfully

- ✅ `src/lib/auth.ts` - Registration logic (working correctly)
- ✅ `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` - Login validation (working correctly)
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema (working correctly)
- ✅ `src/app/api/admin/affiliates/route.ts` - API endpoint (working correctly)
- ✅ **`src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Admin UI (FIXED)**

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Affiliate registers → User.status = 'PENDING' in database
2. ✅ Affiliate tries to login → Gets "pending approval" message
3. ✅ Admin opens Partners page → Sees affiliate in "Pending" tab ← **THIS NOW WORKS**
4. ✅ Admin approves affiliate → Status changes to 'ACTIVE'
5. ✅ Affiliate can now login successfully

## Deployment Notes

1. The fix is a frontend change (React component)
2. No database migration needed
3. No API changes required
4. After deployment, test with a new affiliate registration
5. Existing PENDING users in database will now appear correctly
