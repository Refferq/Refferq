## 📍 The One Line Fix

+ status: aff.user.status,
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Quick Test (2 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Register new affiliate
POST /api/auth/register
{ "name": "Test", "email": "test@test.com" }

# 2. Login as admin → Partners → Pending tab
# Expected: See "Test" in pending list ✅
```

### 2. Database Check
```sql
SELECT email, role, status FROM users WHERE role = 'AFFILIATE' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
-- Should show status = 'PENDING' for new affiliates
```

### 3. Browser Check
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Login as admin
3. Go to Partners page
4. Click "Pending" tab
5. **Expected:** Count badge shows number > 0
6. **Expected:** Pending affiliates visible in list

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Pending affiliates still not showing?

1. **Check browser cache:**
   ```
   Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   ```

2. **Verify database has PENDING users:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE role = 'AFFILIATE' AND status = 'PENDING';
   ```

3. **Check API response:**
   - Open DevTools → Network
   - Go to Partners page
   - Look for `/api/admin/affiliates`
   - Verify response has `user.status = 'PENDING'`

4. **Verify fix is deployed:**
   ```bash
   grep -A5 "const formattedPartners" src/app/admin/page.tsx | grep "status:"
   # Should show: status: aff.user.status,
   # Should NOT show: || 'ACTIVE'
   ```

5. **Restart Next.js:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # or restart production server
   ```
