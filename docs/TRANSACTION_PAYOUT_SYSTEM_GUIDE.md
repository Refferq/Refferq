## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Commission Not Calculated

**Problem:** Transaction created but commission is ₹0

**Solutions:**
1. Check if affiliate has a partner group assigned
2. Verify partner group has a commission rate > 0
3. Check `/api/admin/partner-groups` to see rates
4. Default rate is 20% if no partner group

### Issue: Create Transaction Button Not Visible

**Problem:** Can't see button in Transactions tab

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Check if you're logged in as ADMIN
3. Verify customer ID is correct in URL
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Payout Modal Empty

**Problem:** No commissions shown when clicking Create Payout

**Solutions:**
1. Verify partner has PENDING commissions
2. Check Commissions tab shows pending items
3. Ensure transactions were created (not just leads)
4. Refresh the page

### Issue: Affiliate Not Seeing Earnings

**Problem:** Affiliate dashboard shows ₹0.00

**Solutions:**
1. Verify commissions were created (check admin side)
2. Check if payouts were marked as COMPLETED
3. Affiliate profile API: `/api/affiliate/profile`
4. Check commission status (must be PAID to show in earnings)

### Issue: TypeScript Errors

**Problem:** Type errors in IDE

**Solutions:**
1. Run: `npx prisma generate`
2. Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
3. Close and reopen the file
4. Type assertions are used: `(prisma as any).transaction`
