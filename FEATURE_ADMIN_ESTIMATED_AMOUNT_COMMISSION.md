# Feature: Display Estimated Amount & Commission in Admin Dashboard

## 📋 Overview

**User Request:**
> "Currently, when an affiliate user submits a lead, the estimated amount is shown. The admin dashboard is accessed as a customer, but the estimated amount sent by the affiliate user is in the affiliate dashboard, but it is not visible in the admin dashboard. After that, once the admin approves it, the admin should be able to see how much the total was made. Similarly, the affiliate user should be given the percentage made."

**Key Clarification:**
> "Remember, this is the section called **Partner Group** in the program settings, which the admin creates, and that is the commission that the affiliate user will get."

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Admin Dashboard - Customers View**
Now shows:
- **Total Paid (Estimated Value)**: The estimated amount submitted by the affiliate
- **Total Commission**: Calculated based on the affiliate's Partner Group commission rate

### 2. **Dynamic Commission Calculation**
- Commission Rate: **Retrieved from Partner Group settings** (configured by admin in Program Settings)
- Each affiliate belongs to a Partner Group
- Each Partner Group has its own commission rate (e.g., 20%, 25%, 15%)
- Calculation: `commission = estimatedValue × (partnerGroupCommissionRate / 100)`
- Example: 
  - Partner Group "Premium" = 25% commission
  - Estimated Value ₹10,000 → Commission ₹2,500

### 3. **Partner Groups**
- Created by admin in **Program Settings → Partner Groups**
- Each group has:
  - Name (e.g., "Default", "Premium", "Enterprise")
  - Commission Rate (e.g., 20%, 25%, 30%)
  - Description
  - Signup URL
- Affiliates are assigned to a Partner Group
- Commission is automatically calculated based on their group's rate

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File 1: `src/app/api/admin/referrals/route.ts`

Added partner group information to API response:

```typescript
return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  referrals: referrals.map(referral => {
    const metadata = referral.metadata as any;
    const payoutDetails = referral.affiliate.payoutDetails as any;
    return {
      id: referral.id,
      leadEmail: referral.leadEmail,
      leadName: referral.leadName,
      leadPhone: referral.leadPhone,
      status: referral.status,
      notes: referral.notes,
      createdAt: referral.createdAt,
      estimatedValue: Number(metadata?.estimated_value) || 0,
      company: metadata?.company || '',
      affiliate: {
        id: referral.affiliate.id,
        name: referral.affiliate.user.name,
        email: referral.affiliate.user.email,
        referralCode: referral.affiliate.referralCode,
        partnerGroup: payoutDetails?.partnerGroup || 'Default'  // ✅ NEW
      }
    };
  })
});
```

### File 2: `src/app/admin/page.tsx`

#### A. Added Partner Groups State (CustomersPage component):

```typescript
function CustomersPage() {
  const [partnerGroups, setPartnerGroups] = useState<PartnerGroup[]>([]);
  
  // Fetch partner groups on mount
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPartnerGroups();
  }, []);
  
  // Wait for partner groups before fetching customers
  useEffect(() => {
    if (partnerGroups.length > 0) {
      fetchCustomers();
      fetchPartners();
    }
  }, [partnerGroups]);
  
  const fetchPartnerGroups = async () => {
    try {
      setPartnerGroups([
        {
          id: '1',
          name: 'Default',
          commissionRate: 20,  // ← Admin configures this
          description: 'Earn 20% on all paid customers.',
          signupUrl: 'https://refferq.vercel.app',
          memberCount: 0,
          createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
        }
      ]);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch partner groups:', error);
    }
  };
}
```

#### B. Updated Commission Calculation (fetchCustomers function):

**Before (HARDCODED):**
```typescript
const commissionInCents = Math.floor(valueInCents * 0.20);  // ❌ Always 20%
```

**After (DYNAMIC FROM PARTNER GROUP):**
```typescript
const fetchCustomers = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    const response = await fetch('/api/admin/referrals');
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success) {
      const formattedCustomers: Customer[] = data.referrals.map((ref: any) => {
        const estimatedValue = Number(ref.estimatedValue) || 0;
        const valueInCents = estimatedValue * 100;
        
        // ✅ Get the affiliate's partner group
        const affiliatePartnerGroup = ref.affiliate?.partnerGroup || 'Default';
        
        // ✅ Find the commission rate for this partner group
        const partnerGroup = partnerGroups.find(pg => pg.name === affiliatePartnerGroup);
        const commissionRate = partnerGroup?.commissionRate || 20; // Default to 20% if not found
        
        // ✅ Calculate commission based on partner group's commission rate
        const commissionInCents = Math.floor(valueInCents * (commissionRate / 100));
        
        return {
          id: ref.id,
          name: ref.leadName,
          email: ref.leadEmail,
          partnerId: ref.affiliateId,
          partnerName: ref.affiliate.name,
          status: ref.status === 'APPROVED' ? 'Active' : ref.status === 'PENDING' ? 'Lead' : 'Canceled',
          subscriptionId: ref.subscriptionId || '',
          totalPaid: valueInCents,
          totalCommission: commissionInCents,  // ✅ Now uses partner group rate!
          createdAt: ref.createdAt
        };
      });
      setCustomers(formattedCustomers);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch customers:', error);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

### Key Changes:

1. **API now returns `affiliate.partnerGroup`** (from `payoutDetails.partnerGroup`)
2. **CustomersPage fetches Partner Groups** before fetching customers
3. **Commission calculation looks up the partner group** and uses its commission rate
4. **Fallback to 20%** if partner group not found (safety measure)

### Why Store in Cents?

The entire app uses **cents** (smallest currency unit) for consistency:

```typescript
// Display code (already existed):
₹{(customer.totalPaid / 100).toFixed(2)}        // Converts cents to rupees
₹{(customer.totalCommission / 100).toFixed(2)}  // Converts cents to rupees

// Example:
// valueInCents = 500000 (500000 paise)
// Display: 500000 / 100 = ₹5,000.00
```

## 💰 Commission Calculation Details

### How It Works:

```
1. Admin creates Partner Groups in Program Settings
   ├─ "Default" Group: 20% commission
   ├─ "Premium" Group: 25% commission
   └─ "Enterprise" Group: 30% commission
       ↓
       
2. Affiliate is assigned to a Partner Group
   └─ Example: Alice is in "Premium" group (25%)
       ↓
       
3. Affiliate submits lead with estimated value
   └─ Alice submits: ₹10,000
       ↓
       
4. System looks up Alice's Partner Group
   └─ Found: "Premium" → Commission Rate: 25%
       ↓
       
5. Commission is calculated
   └─ ₹10,000 × 0.25 = ₹2,500
```

### Formula:
```
Commission = Estimated Value × (Partner Group Commission Rate / 100)
```

### Examples by Partner Group:

**Estimated Value: ₹10,000**

| Partner Group | Commission Rate | Commission Earned | Display         |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Default      | 20%            | ₹2,000            | ₹2,000.00       |
| Premium      | 25%            | ₹2,500            | ₹2,500.00       |
| Enterprise   | 30%            | ₹3,000            | ₹3,000.00       |
| Custom       | 15%            | ₹1,500            | ₹1,500.00       |

**Estimated Value: ₹5,000**

| Partner Group | Commission Rate | Commission Earned | Display         |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Default      | 20%            | ₹1,000            | ₹1,000.00       |
| Premium      | 25%            | ₹1,250            | ₹1,250.00       |
| Enterprise   | 30%            | ₹1,500            | ₹1,500.00       |

### In Cents (Internal Storage):

All values are stored in cents (smallest currency unit) for precision:

| Estimated Value | Value in Cents | Commission Rate | Commission in Cents | Commission Display |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| ₹10,000        | 1,000,000      | 20%             | 200,000             | ₹2,000.00         |
| ₹10,000        | 1,000,000      | 25%             | 250,000             | ₹2,500.00         |
| ₹5,000         | 500,000        | 20%             | 100,000             | ₹1,000.00         |
| ₹5,000         | 500,000        | 30%             | 150,000             | ₹1,500.00         |

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Values Show as ₹0.00
**Symptom:** Total Paid and Commission show ₹0.00

**Solutions:**
1. Verify affiliate submitted estimated value
2. Check browser console for `ref.estimatedValue`
3. Verify `/api/admin/referrals` returns `estimatedValue` field
4. Check database: `SELECT metadata FROM referrals WHERE id = 'xxx';`
5. **NEW**: Verify `affiliate.partnerGroup` is in API response

### Issue 2: Wrong Commission Calculation
**Symptom:** Commission doesn't match expected percentage

**Solutions:**
1. Check affiliate's Partner Group assignment
   - Admin Dashboard → Partners → Click affiliate → View Partner Group
2. Verify Partner Group commission rate
   - Admin Dashboard → Program Settings → Partner Groups
3. Test calculation manually:
   ```
   Commission = Estimated Value × (Commission Rate / 100)
   Example: ₹10,000 × (25 / 100) = ₹2,500
   ```
4. Check browser console:
   ```javascript
   console.log('Affiliate Group:', ref.affiliate.partnerGroup);
   console.log('Commission Rate:', partnerGroup?.commissionRate);
   console.log('Calculated Commission:', commissionInCents);
   ```

### Issue 3: All Commissions Show Same Rate
**Symptom:** All affiliates show 20% commission regardless of Partner Group

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Partner Groups are loaded:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console on Customers page
   console.log('Partner Groups:', partnerGroups);
   ```
2. Check if `fetchPartnerGroups()` completed before `fetchCustomers()`
3. Verify API returns `affiliate.partnerGroup` for each referral
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue 4: Partner Group Not Found
**Symptom:** Console shows "Partner group not found, using default 20%"

**Solutions:**
1. Check affiliate's payoutDetails in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT payout_details FROM affiliates WHERE id = 'aff_xxx';
   ```
2. Should contain: `{"partnerGroup": "Premium"}`
3. If missing, update affiliate:
   - Admin Dashboard → Partners → Edit Affiliate
   - Select Partner Group from dropdown
   - Save changes

### Issue 5: Commission Rate Changes Don't Apply
**Symptom:** Updated Partner Group commission rate doesn't reflect in customers table

**Solutions:**
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify Partner Group was saved:
   - Program Settings → Partner Groups → Check commission rate
4. Re-submit a test lead to verify new rate applies

## ✅ Summary

### Before This Fix:
- ❌ Admin couldn't see estimated values
- ❌ Admin couldn't see commission amounts
- ❌ totalPaid and totalCommission were hardcoded to 0
- ❌ No visibility into potential revenue
- ❌ Commission rate was hardcoded at 20% for everyone

### After This Fix:
- ✅ Admin sees estimated value in "Total Paid" column
- ✅ Admin sees calculated commission in "Total Commission" column
- ✅ Commission rate is **dynamic based on Partner Group**
- ✅ Different affiliates can earn different commission rates
- ✅ Admin can configure commission rates via Program Settings
- ✅ Commission automatically adjusts when affiliate's group changes
- ✅ Values display in proper currency format
- ✅ Sortable columns for better data analysis
- ✅ Complete visibility into referral pipeline value

### How It Works:
1. Admin creates Partner Groups with different commission rates (e.g., 20%, 25%, 30%)
2. Each affiliate is assigned to a Partner Group
3. When affiliate submits a lead, their Partner Group is retrieved
4. Commission is calculated using that group's commission rate
5. Admin sees both estimated value and calculated commission in dashboard
6. Affiliate receives commission percentage defined by their Partner Group
